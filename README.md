PacSimUCS:
  Pac man pathfinding simulation algorithm whose goal is to find the optimal path through a Pac man style grid, while being constrained to
  pass through all food pellets on the grid. Implemented using Uniform Cost Search and graph search.
  
Planner:
  Table-Block planner for finding the optimal ordered steps for going from a starting configuration of stacked blocks to a final
  configuration of stacked blocks with 'step-constraints' where: One block is moved per step and final configuration details specific
  ordering of stack arrangements.
  
Perceptron:
  [Non-multilayer] Perceptron algorithm implementation for demonstrating unsupervised learning on a given data set.
